 Future Africa Minds Academy  is an ambitious, impact-driven initiative designed to equip children and youth across Africa with vital technology and programming skills, starting from as early as age 8.

This project responds to a growing concern: Africa is advancing digitally, but many of our young people lack the foundational skills to seize emerging opportunities. The tech revolution waits for no one  and neither should our children.
